# Laffy

Dad jokes are great, right? But you know what's even better than dad jokes... dad jokes WITH ANIMATED GIFS!!

Laffy combines the best of both worlds and provides a simple, elegant, and HILARIOUS web application to induce uproarious laffter in even the most serious viewer.

Laffy is built with vanilla javascript and utilizes data from [GIPHY.com](https://giphy.com/) and [icanhazdadjoke.com](https://icanhazdadjoke.com/)
